Researchers used advanced genetic engineering techniques to transform 
a bacterial protein into a new research tool. The sensor could detect subtle, 
real-time changes in brain serotonin levels during sleep, fear, and social interactions, 
as well as test the effectiveness of new psychoactive drugs. The study was funded, in part, 
by the NIH''s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative 
which aims to revolutionize our understanding of the brain under healthy and disease conditions. 
In the spirit of the BRAIN Initiative, the researchers plan to make the sensor readily available to 
other scientists. They hope that it will help researchers gain a better understanding. of the critical 
role serotonin plays in our daily lives and in many psychiatric conditions. If the US National 
Institutes of Health has its way, there would be some extensive research on brain on an unprecedented 
scale in the next 10 years. With nearly 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections, the human 
brain remains one of the greatest mysteries in science and medicine. Neurological and psychiatric 
disorders, such as Alzheimerâ€s, Parkinsonâ™s, autism, schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, and autism, 
are all major challenges in working with the brain. A working group of the National Institute of 
Health (NIH) has presented a 10-year plan for the agency's portion of a major neuroscience initiative 
announced last year by President Obama.
